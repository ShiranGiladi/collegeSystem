# collegeSystem

During my studies, my partner and I developed a web application - a College Grade System for students, lecturers, and administrators. I would like to share the project and its key features with you.

🚀 Project Overview:
Our application was built using cutting-edge technologies, including React, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, and MongoDB.

📚 Features for Students:
Students can access detailed assignment information for each course, such as task names, submission dates, their grades, and more.

👨‍🏫 Features for Lecturers:
Lecturers can easily add new assignments, update existing ones, and manage grades in two convenient ways - either by uploading an Excel file or manually entering student IDs and their grades.

👨‍💼 Features for Administrators:
Administrators have the authority to add new users, edit user details, assign courses to users, and more.

🌓 Dark Mode:
Recognizing the importance of user preferences, we incorporated Dark Mode into our web application.

🌐📱 Deployment and Mobile Optimization:
To ensure widespread accessibility, we deployed the application using Render for the backend and Netlify for the frontend. The web application is also optimized for mobile devices.
